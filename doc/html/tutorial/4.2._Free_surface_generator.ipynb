    "1. Generating a bulk crystalline system with all periodic boundaries.\n",
    "2. Slicing the system along a geometrical plane creating two ideal planar-sliced free surfaces.\n",

    "While these steps are conceptually simple, it is still tricky to create a routine that can successfully work for any crystal plane in any crystal. The main challenge in developing a generalized free surface routine is working with the multiple different axes systems that describe the defect and the atomic configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planar free surfaces are typically defined as crystallographic $(hkl)$ Miller or $(hkil)$ Miller-Bravais planes relative to conventional unit cells with lattice box vectors of $a_{unit}$, $b_{unit}$, and $c_{unit}$. [Sun and Cedar](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.susc.2013.05.016) showed an algorithm that can be easily used to identify the Cartesian slip plane normal for any $(hkl)$ plane in any crystal. In atomman, this is handled by atomman.tools.miller.plane_crystal_to_cartesian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Cartesian plane normal, a search is then performed to identify three $[uvw]$ crystal vectors corresponding to\n",
    "\n",
    "- The crystal vector with absolute $h$, $k$, and $l$ values less than some search maximum that is closest to the plane normal.\n",

    "Uniqueness is supported by only picking vectors that form a right-handed system and which have the smallest angle between the two in-plane vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rotated cell is then constructed in which the rotated cell's box vectors $a_{rot}$, $b_{rot}$, and $c_{rot}$ correspond to the three $[uvw]$ Miller vectors of the unit cell. The specific alignment of the rotated cell depends on which box vector the free surface cut will be made along, i.e. the \"cut box vector\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cut box vector is aligned with the out-of-plane crystal vector.\n",
    "- The Cartesian system for the rotated cell is defined such that the cut box vector is the only box vector with a component along one of the three x, y, or z Cartesian axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice means that the free surface can be inserted into the system easily by making the boundary conditions along the cut box vector non-periodic.  As the other two box vectors are in-plane vectors, the resulting free surface plane is the plane of interest. Also, the choice of Cartesian system mentioned will result in the plane normal coinciding with one of the three Cartesian axes.\n",

    "- __cutboxvector__ (*str, optional*) Specifies which of the three box vectors corresponds to the out-of-plane vector.  Default value is c.\n",
