    "A stacking fault atomic configuration can be constructed by\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating a bulk crystalline system with all periodic boundaries.\n",
    "2. Slicing the system along a geometrical plane creating two ideal planar-sliced free surfaces.\n",
    "3. Specifying a geometrical fault plane that is parallel to the free surfaces and divides the atoms (roughly) in half. \n",
    "4. Rigidly shifting all atoms on one side of the fault plane by the same shift vector, $\\mathbf{d}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two steps correspond with the construction of a planar-sliced free surface configuration. The corresponding theory for those steps is outlined in the [Free surface configuration generator Notebook](4.2._Free_surface_generator.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the free surface has been constructed, a stacking fault configuration can be defined by specifying the location to position the fault plane, and a fault shift $\\mathbf{d}$ to apply. For the plane position, it is usually convenient to select the halfway point in the system. If the system was constructed with an even number of replicas in the direction normal to the fault/surface planes, then placing the fault plane in the middle of the system will result in the fault plane matching the free surface plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the fault plane can be explored in 2 dimensions, the applied shift, $\\mathbf{d}$, can be expressed using two non-parallel vectors within the fault plane, $\\mathbf{a_1}$ and $\\mathbf{a_2}$. Taking $\\mathbf{a_1}$ and $\\mathbf{a_2}$ as lattice slip vectors (i.e. vectors between two symmetrically identical lattice sites) will define a 2D cell encompassing all possible unique stacking fault shifts for the fault plane.  $\\mathbf{d}$ can then be represented using fractional coordinates, $a_1$ and $a_2$, relative to $\\mathbf{a_1}$ and $\\mathbf{a_2}$\n",

    "$$ \\mathbf{d} = a_1 \\mathbf{a_1} + a_2 \\mathbf{a_2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the free surface configuration was generated using a primitive unit cell, then the two in-plane box vectors of the intermediate rotated cell will correspond to the shortest in-plane lattice vectors. As such, using those box vectors will result in the smallest periodic 2D cell necessary to fully explore the stacking fault map."
