    "\n",
    "This Notebook outlines the mep subpackage of atomman that provides tools for identifying minimum energy pathways. These tools were designed primarily for finding relaxed energy paths along 2D energy maps, but may also work for more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE #1__ This documentation uses the term \"energy\" for the output of the evaluation function and the term \"force\" for the derivative of the evaluation function with respect to the coordinates.  This does not mean that the evaluation function needs to be in units of energy, just that it is a function analogous to energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note #2__ The atomman.mep module is relatively new and only contains a few options at the moment.  The code has been designed with modularity in mind, so additional methods can hopefully be added in the future without requiring too many changes to the existing design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Theory and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum energy paths are transition paths from one (meta)stable state to another in which each point along the path is located at a minimum for all directions tangent to the path's line.  Another way of stating this is that every point along the path has a gradient of zero for all directions except along the path's line.  The minimum energy path for a transition is important as it marks the most likely states that the system will occupy during a transition and it provides an accurate means of identifying the transition barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atomman.mep module contains Path classes.  Each Path class provides\n",
    "- A representation of a path along an energy surface as a series of coordinates,\n",
    "- Methods that allow for the integration of the path towards the minimum energy path using a particular relaxation algorithm, and\n",
    "- Tools for viewing the path, as well as the energies and forces along the path.\n"
